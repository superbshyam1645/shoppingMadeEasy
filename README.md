## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

a full responsive react shopping website with some feature like anonymous login, sign in and sign up,  cart, wishlist and more things. also used firebase for everything i said plus save the files on storage, auth for login and keep the product information on realtime database.

## ⚙ How Does It Work? <a name="work"></a>
When you enter the website, you are anonymously log in to website(thanks to firebase auth for a lot of free features). so if you add anything to cart or wishlist, its will be save on the database, so forgot about lose data. if you want to access this data from other device, you should register or use google sign in(again thanks to firebase auth) and will be automatically transfered to your account and you will be see it on any device!.
